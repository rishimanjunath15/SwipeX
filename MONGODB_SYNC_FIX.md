# Bug Fixes: MongoDB Sync & Question 6 Saving

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Redux State Not Clearing When Data Deleted from MongoDB Atlas
**Problem**: When a candidate was deleted directly from MongoDB Atlas, the Redux persisted state remained in the browser's localStorage, causing stale data to persist.

**Solution**:
- Created new API endpoint: `/api/check-candidate` that verifies if a candidate exists in MongoDB
- Added automatic check on component mount in `IntervieweePage.jsx`
- If candidate email exists in Redux state but not in MongoDB, automatically clears all local state
- Ensures data consistency between MongoDB and client state

**Files Changed**:
- `server/routes/checkCandidate.js` - New route to check candidate existence
- `server/server.js` - Registered new route
- `client/src/pages/IntervieweePage.jsx` - Added useEffect to check on mount

### 2. Question 6 Not Saving Answer and Score
**Problem**: The 6th question showed "(No answer provided)" and "0/100" score in the Interviewer tab even when the candidate provided an answer that received a score.

**Root Cause**: Timing issue with Redux state updates. The `generateFinalSummary` function was being called before the Redux state had fully updated with the last question's answer and evaluation.

**Solution**:
- Created new function `generateFinalSummaryWithQuestions` that accepts questions as an explicit parameter
- Modified the answer submission flow for the last question to:
  1. Update Redux state with answer and score
  2. Wait for state to settle (1500ms)
  3. Manually construct the complete questions array with all data
  4. Pass this explicit array to the summary generation
- Added detailed console logging to track question data through the save process
- Ensures Question 6 has all data (answer, score, feedback) before saving to database

**Files Changed**:
- `client/src/pages/IntervieweePage.jsx` - Enhanced answer submission and summary generation logic

## Technical Details

### Candidate Existence Check Flow
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (candidate?.email) {
    // Check if candidate exists in MongoDB
    const response = await apiClient.post('/api/check-candidate', {
      email: candidate.email,
    });
    
    // If deleted from MongoDB, clear local state
    if (!response.data.exists) {
      dispatch(resetInterview());
      dispatch(clearProfile());
      // Clear all local state
    }
  }
}, []);
```

### Question 6 Save Flow (Fixed)
```javascript
if (isLastQuestion) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    // Construct complete questions array with latest data
    const updatedQuestions = interview.questions.map((q, idx) => {
      if (idx === interview.currentQuestionIndex) {
        return {
          ...q,
          answer: answer || '',
          score: evalData.score,
          feedback: evalData.feedback,
          timeTaken: q.timeLimit - (interview.timeRemaining || 0),
        };
      }
      return q;
    });
    
    // Pass explicit questions array
    generateFinalSummaryWithQuestions(updatedQuestions);
  }, 1500);
}
```

## Testing Checklist

### MongoDB Sync Test
- [ ] Complete an interview with a candidate
- [ ] Delete the candidate from MongoDB Atlas
- [ ] Refresh the browser
- [ ] Verify Redux state is automatically cleared
- [ ] Verify you see the initial upload screen (not stale data)

### Question 6 Saving Test
- [ ] Start a new interview
- [ ] Answer all 6 questions
- [ ] Verify Question 6 answer is displayed in the Interviewee view
- [ ] Check the Interviewer tab
- [ ] Verify Question 6 shows the actual answer (not "No answer provided")
- [ ] Verify Question 6 shows the correct score (not 0/100)
- [ ] Verify total score includes Question 6's score

## Impact
- ✅ Data consistency maintained between MongoDB and client
- ✅ No more stale data after deletions
- ✅ All 6 questions now save completely with answers and scores
- ✅ Interviewer dashboard displays accurate interview results
- ✅ Better debugging with console logging for question data flow

## Deployment Notes
- Both client and server changes required
- No database migration needed
- No breaking changes to existing data structure
- Backward compatible with existing candidates in database
